## This is a little something I put together on the train back from Railsconf in Baltimore to my home in Richmond, VA

On the last day they announced whyday ( http://whyday.org/ ) and I love _why, him and his chunky bacon being 
in large part responsible for why I got into Ruby and Rails in the first place.  

If you have never read his poignant guide to ruby ( http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/ ) then you should stop whatever
you are doing (unless you're saving someone's life) and read it now.  Things will wait.  


It is a script for _whys bloopsaphone, which I had heard about but never used before.  
You can get it by copy and pasting the same instructions I did, found here (thanks for posting them!).

If you want to know how to use the bloopsaphone I suggest you navigate to the directory where the gem is installed and 
look at what _why wrote about it, there isn't a whole lot to it.

`
master>gem list blo -d   

*** LOCAL GEMS ***

bloopsaphone (0.4)

    Homepage: http://github.com/why/bloopsaphone
    Installed at: /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8

    arcade sounds and chiptunes

Or you can look at what I've done with it, or maybe just listen to what I've done with it, and reflect a bit.  

Feel free to borrow or steal any part of what I've done, and if you do let me know about it.  








p.s.  _why if you read this, send me a postcard.
