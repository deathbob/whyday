## This is a little something I put together on the train back from Railsconf in Baltimore to my home in Richmond, VA.

On the last day they announced whyday [http://whyday.org/](http://whyday.org/) and I love _why, him and his chunky bacon being 
in large part responsible for why I got into Ruby and Rails in the first place.  

If you have never read his poignant guide to ruby [http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/) then you should stop whatever
you are doing (unless you're saving someone's life) and read it now.  Things will wait.  


It is a script for _whys bloopsaphone, which I had heard about but never used before.  
You can get it by copy and pasting the same instructions I did, found here (thanks for posting them!).

code reproduced below in case that site goes away
    sudo port install portaudio
    sudo gem install bloopsaphone -- --with-opt-lib=/opt/local/lib --with-opt-include=/opt/local/include


If you want to know how to use the bloopsaphone I suggest you navigate to the directory where the gem is installed and 
look at what _why wrote about it, there isn't a whole lot to it.


    master>gem list blo -d

Or you can look at what I've done with it, or maybe just listen to what I've done with it, and have a nice pensive glass of scotch.  

Feel free to borrow or steal any part of what I've done, if you do let me know about it.
